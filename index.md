We, Cherie Deur (OT) of Play to Grow and Heather Edey (SLP) have been working with children and young adults with complex communication, motor, and sensory needs for over 30 years collectively. These enriching and powerful experiences have inspired us to develop a unique program, Building Blocks for Play and Communication, for young children with complex communication, motor, and sensory needs and their families.

## Building Blocks for Play and Communication: Mission Statement

Children learn through movement, interaction, and play. Our passion is to empower young children to interact meaningfully and actively with family, friends, their community, and their environment. Active learners become confident participants and confident communicators.

We’re passionate about modifying the environment to fit the child. Too often children with complex motor and sensory needs face barriers in their environment. We want to help children and families experience the joy of communicating through active play and ignite belief in their own capacities.  

Our ten-week program’s mission is to enable parents of young children with complex communication, sensory, and motor needs to facilitate their children’s active engagement and interaction with their world.

### About our Program

Building Blocks for Play and Communication is a ten session program developed for children 1.5-3 years of age who have complex communication, motor, and/or sensory needs. The program will run weekly, from 10:00 am - 11:00 am, starting on Friday, March 3rd and ending onl Friday, May 12th (there will be no program on Good Friday, April 14th.)
